Streamline-Vorticity formulation to solve the 2D cavity flow problem

A C Code to solve the Lid Driven Cavity problem.                                                                      
Streamline-Vorticity Formulation derived from Navier-Stokes Equation for 2D Case is used to develop the algorithm.
