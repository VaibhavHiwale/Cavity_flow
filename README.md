Streamline-Vorticity formulation to solve the 2D cavity flow problem

A C Code to solve the Lid Driven Cavity problem.                                                                      
Streamline-Vorticity Formulation derived from Navier-Stokes Equation for 2D Case is used to develop the algorithm.

Directly run the .c file the grid but can be changed inside the code.
the code will ask for the desired reynolds number.
the result file in .csv format will generated once solution get converged.
